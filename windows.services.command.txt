REM     Also if you need to pass extra parameters in the binPath that require quotes they have to be escaped (\") 
REM     example: if the path was c:\some long path\some.exe "first argument" 
REM     it would need to be binPath= "\"c:\some long path\some.exe\" \"first argument\"" â€“ Lankymart Jul 16 '15 at 13:38
