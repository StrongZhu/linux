# find all files like
#     /etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml
#     /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
#
# add
#     optional: true
# to any devices that may not always be available.

# solution 2
#
# disable the wait-online service to prevent the system from waiting on a network connection
systemctl disable systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
#
# prevent the service from starting if requested by another service (the service is symlinked to /dev/null).
systemctl mask systemd-networkd-wait-online.service
